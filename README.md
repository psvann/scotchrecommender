# Scotch Recommendation Engine (Tutorial)
This tutorial code uses the classic Scotch comparison dataset (foudn in [Data Science for Business](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-science-for/9781449374273/) by O'Reilly Media) to build a recommendation system. We first build a cosine similarity matrix for our recommendations using Python Pandas, output the results to a CSV, create a sample Flask application to serve results, and finally Dockerize the application for deployment. 

This tutorial was originally built for the [SlimDevOps Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/slimdevops). [More information can be found here.](https://community.slim.ai/t/simple-recommendation-system-with-python-scikit-learn-and-dockerslim/95)
